Hello!

I'm cctjallorina/clydejallorina, and this is a pre-alpha, playable version of a bullet hell game that we made.
It's currently really simple and not so extravagant. We currently only have placeholder bullets, sprites, and backgrounds.
Heck, even the name's a placeholder!

But really, this is such a massive undertaking to perform in just a few weeks, as I am new to using Canvases and HTML5.

The reason why it's here in GitHub is because this is a really convenient place to update the versions.

This pre-alpha is already graded, and we might proceed to make it an actual bullet hell with the right music, graphics, etc.

Thanks, and have fun!
